        <div id="centrum" class="box"><h2> The Great kingdom Calrissian</h2>
        <h1> History </h1>
        <p>Founded only two hundred years ago, after the merging of the human kingdom of Calania and the dwarven queendom
           Drergnirit after the marriage of human king Calleral and dwarven queen Krishna. It has experienced moderate
           prosperity for most of it’s existence. It has not been involved in any wars until just recently when the ratfolk
           state of Killya decided to expand its borders. So far the war is not going great, with the ratfolk’s more advanced
           technology and chemical and biological weapons overpowering the larger human/dwarven army.</p>

    style='position:absolute;top:70px;right:165px; width:150px' alt='cool drawing' />
        <h1> Culture </h1>
        <p>Since the east is traditionally dwarven territory, most of the people living there are dwarfs and most of the architecture
        is dwarven. The west side (represent!) is mostly human, but the culture includes a lot of dwarven elements, like ale,
        shit tons of ale. Most of the people outside of the major cities are weary of outsiders. Because of the war, many towns
        are without guards, and people have started to need to either rely on themselves or hire sellswords to solve their problems.
        There is no kingdom wide organised church.</p>

        <h1> Nature </h1>
        <p>Most of the country is covered in a thick pine forest, with little wildlife. Most herbivores live either in rivers or are
          quite small. Some ruminants like stags and mooses are the exception to this rule. Because of the small amount of larger prey,
          carnivores are mostly territorial creatures like giant spiders, wolfs, bears, drakes and trolls. Some magical beast reside here
          to, but because of strong planar barriers, they are very rare and most of them are Gremlins and everybody hates those.</p>

        <h1> Politics </h1>
        <p>The current leader of Calrissian is the half-dwarf-half-human Gredlig the Acceptable, son of Calleral and Krishna. Most dwarfs
          don’t like him that much because they would rather a dwarf ruled them, most humans don’t like him that much because they would
          rather a human ruled them. So far he has had no major fuck-ups, and he even slowed down the losing of the war with his great
          tactical skill and unlikely level of luck. He is wedded to the human Lady Alaira, the baroness of Utjis. Before their marriage
          she was one of the lowest nobles in the land, and many people consider the low birth of their queen to be a insult to their country.
           The have one daughter called Elisia, and everybody hopes they will get a son before their death, because she sucks. </p>
        <p>As for international relations, as noted before they are at war with the ratfolk nation of Killya to the west, a small, but
          technologically advanced state. There is a human state to the south, called Greatland, and some trade exists between that and Calrissian.
           There is also a Gnome/Halfling country to the east called Gromsîsh, but no one knows how to pronounce its name so they just ignore it.
            To the north there is sea, in which no humanoid species lives, since it’s too cold for merfolk, and too shallow for deep merfolk.</p></div>
